# Reverse Number Sequence Script

This script reads a sequence of inputs from the user, one per line, ending when the number `0` is entered. It then displays the sequence of inputs in reverse order, excluding the terminating `0`.

## How the Script Works

1. The script starts by initializing variables `num` to `1` and `i` to `0`.
2. It enters a `while` loop that reads numbers from the user until `0` is entered. The numbers are stored in an array `arr`.
3. Once `0` is entered, the loop stops reading numbers.
4. Another `while` loop is used to print the numbers stored in the array in reverse order.
5. The script then exits.

## Exit Status

The script exits with status 0 upon completion.
