# Bash Script: Morning or Afternoon Greeting

This script asks the user whether it is morning or not and provides an appropriate greeting based on the response.

### Usage

1. Run the script in a terminal.
2. Enter `yes` if it is morning or `no` if it is not.
3. The script will display "Good morning!" or "Good afternoon!" based on your input. If the input is neither `yes` nor `no`, it will display "Invalid response!".

### How It Works

- Prompts the user to indicate if it is morning with a `yes` or `no` answer.
- Responds with "Good morning!" if the answer is `yes`.
- Responds with "Good afternoon!" if the answer is `no`.
- Displays "Invalid response!" for any other input.
